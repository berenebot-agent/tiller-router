# Security policy

Tiller Router is a beta release. Please do not disclose a suspected
vulnerability in a public issue, discussion, or pull request.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository: open the
repository's **Security** tab, choose **Report a vulnerability**, and submit a
private security advisory. This is the supported reporting channel; no public
email address is assumed or required.

Include enough information to reproduce the issue safely, such as the affected
version or commit, deployment shape, request path (without credentials or
personal data), impact, and a minimal reproduction. Please redact provider
credentials, client API keys, session cookies, prompts, and responses.

We will acknowledge reports when practical and coordinate a fix, disclosure,
and credit with the reporter. There is no guaranteed response or remediation
SLA for beta releases.

## Scope and deployment notes

The Docker Compose deployment deliberately publishes `TILLER_PORT` on all host
interfaces for direct LAN access. Restrict it with the host firewall or a
private network when public/direct access is not intended. Keep the admin
interface private, use HTTPS at the edge, protect `./data`, and never commit
`.env` or provider credentials. Proxy-header trust must remain disabled unless
the direct proxy peer is restricted with `TILLER_TRUSTED_PROXY`.

The main Compose deployment remains the simple self-hosted appliance. The
separate `docker-compose.hosted.yml` override removes direct host-port
publishing and uses explicit networks rather than the implicit Compose default
network. Tiller is attached to a managed `tiller-router-egress` network
containing only Tiller and to an ingress network used by the reverse proxy. A
proxy in another Compose project can use an existing network with
`TILLER_INGRESS_NETWORK` and `TILLER_INGRESS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL=true`. This
network layout requires no host firewall configuration and does not alter
local/LAN provider support. Hosted mode requires `TILLER_TRUSTED_PROXY` to
identify the direct reverse proxy peer so client IP limits and audit records
use the forwarded client address. It is defense in depth only: hosted outbound
requests remain subject to the application `SafeTransport`, and operators may
add provider-specific VPS firewall rules separately.

**Recoverable provider credentials are encrypted at rest (always on).**
Provider API credentials, OAuth access/refresh/id tokens and `provider_data`, the
notification auth header, and hosted mail credentials are sealed with AES-256-GCM (versioned `enc:v1:`
format, unique nonce per value, associated data binding the account/record/field)
at the `internal/store` boundary. The master key is kept **outside the database**:
set `TILLER_MASTER_KEY` (base64 of 32 random bytes) or `TILLER_MASTER_KEY_FILE`
(takes precedence), or let Tiller generate one at `<data dir>/master.key` (0600)
on first start. **Back the master key up separately from `./data`** — without it,
existing encrypted credentials cannot be recovered. A database dump therefore
does not reveal provider credentials; a full `./data` archive does include the
generated key and must be protected as a secret. Rotate the key with
`tiller-router rotate-master-key` (service stopped; new key via
`TILLER_MASTER_KEY_NEW` or `TILLER_MASTER_KEY_NEW_FILE`). If encrypted values
exist but the key is missing or wrong, Tiller starts in a **locked** state:
credential-bearing providers are unavailable and no plaintext credential can be
written until the correct key is restored.

Migration 024 clears request and provider response body columns from the live
database; it is not secure erasure. SQLite pages, WAL files, snapshots, and old
backups may still contain historic sensitive data, so they must continue to be
protected as sensitive material.

**Secret hashing is entropy-tiered.** Non-recoverable secrets (client API keys,
admin session tokens, the admin credential fingerprint) are hash-only at rest;
plaintext is never stored. The admin credential fingerprint is human-chosen and
low-entropy, so it is protected with a memory-hard KDF (**argon2id, 64 MiB**).
Client API keys and admin session tokens are 256-bit uniformly random, where
offline brute force is infeasible regardless of hash speed; those use
**bcrypt (cost ≥ 10)**, whose fixed ~4 KiB working set avoids the ~64 MiB
per-verify memory cost that dominated the process footprint under concurrent
authentication. Existing argon2id values keep verifying (algorithm is
dispatched from the encoding) and are upgraded to bcrypt lazily on the next
successful authentication, so the tiering change needs no forced migration or
downtime.

**Auth caches and revocation.** Verified client keys and admin sessions are
cached in memory and the cache entry renews on use; the TTLs are configurable
(client key 15m, session 5m by default, clamped to ≤24h). Revocation does not
wait for the TTL: any client-key or session mutation invalidates the affected
cache entries immediately, and credential changes revoke all sessions. The TTL
is therefore a *cross-instance* revocation bound — with a single process it has
no security effect, and the sliding cache exists to keep hash-verification cost
proportional to the rate of distinct/expired keys rather than request volume.
Both caches are periodically swept and capped so they cannot grow unbounded.

**Hosted identity.** `TILLER_MODE=hosted` enables email/password accounts. Human
passwords use Argon2id (64 MiB/3/4); verification and reset links are opaque,
single-use, short-lived, and hash-only at rest. Customer sessions and platform
operator sessions use separate host-only Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite cookies and
CSRF tokens. Account suspension immediately revokes customer sessions and
blocks client-key traffic. Hosted detailed body logging is unavailable even if
the account settings request attempts to enable it. Customer login and recovery
requests have in-memory per-IP budgets; login and recovery also use normalized-
email keyed throttles. The per-email login failure lockout can temporarily block
an account after repeated failed attempts regardless of source IP; this targeted
denial-of-service tradeoff is accepted for beta and can be revisited if observed.

**Account self-service.** Hosted customers manage their identity from the
Account tab. Changing the password or email, signing out everywhere, and
deleting the account all require the current password. Email changes are
verify-new-first: the current address remains the login identity until a link
sent to the **new** address is confirmed, a warning is mailed to the **current**
address at request time, and confirmation revokes every other session. A pending
email change is cancelled by a password reset or an authenticated password
change. Requesting a change to an address already owned by another account
returns the same generic response but sends no mail, so the endpoint cannot be
used to mail another customer. Self-service deletion is synchronous and
terminal, sharing one purge path with operator deletion; account audit history
is retained.

**Durable transactional mail.** Signup, verification, password-reset, and
email-change messages are queued in a `mail_outbox` row inside the same
transaction that creates the one-time token, then delivered by a background
worker with bounded retries. The raw one-time token stored in the payload is
encrypted at rest with the same always-on master key (`enc:v1:`, AAD-bound to
the row) and is scrubbed on successful send, so a leaked database or backup does
not yield an account takeover. Rows that exhaust their retries are dead-lettered
and surface on the platform dashboard; queued and recently dead counts are shown
to the operator.

Platform administration uses the environment-only
`TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
credentials at `/platform`. Customers use separate email/password identities at
`/login`; neither session type elevates into the other. Existing local
deployments can provide `TILLER_USERNAME` / `TILLER_PASSWORD` (or the deprecated
`TILLER_ADMIN_*` aliases) once during hosted startup to migrate
`LocalAccountID` into a verified customer account. The database migration state
distinguishes a fresh hosted install from an existing local database; hosted
startup fails closed if an existing local account has no valid migration
credentials. Fresh hosted deployments do not create a customer from the
platform credential.

**Detailed error logging (opt-in).** Activity is metadata-only by default. If the
administrator enables the Detailed Error Logging setting, failed request bodies
and provider error bodies are stored (bounded to 1 MiB). Activity exports
containing those records must be treated as sensitive. The setting defaults to
disabled and is presented with a warning in the admin UI. This is the documented
exception to the AGENTS.md no-content guardrail, which is scoped to default
logging.

**Hosted quota and onboarding controls.** Hosted accounts are subject to plan
entitlements (provider/client-key/virtual-model creation, concurrent streams,
monthly routed requests, and Activity retention). Quota rejections are `429`
with `Retry-After` and occur after authentication and model resolution but
before any upstream request. Local/self-hosted mode is exempt.

**Account data export.** Hosted customers can export their own account as a ZIP
(configuration JSON, Activity CSV, audit CSV). The export is account-scoped from
the verified session and never contains provider credentials, OAuth tokens, or
client-key secrets or hashes. It is distinct from the administrator-only
whole-database backup export, which remains restricted to local mode.

**Published legal documents.** Terms, Privacy, AUP, Subprocessor List, and the
Security/Data Handling page are operator-editable and served publicly so signup
can link them before authentication. Signup records the accepted document
timestamps in `legal_acceptances`.

For questions that are not security reports, please use the project's normal
public issue and discussion channels.
