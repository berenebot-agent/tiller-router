# Third-party notices

Tiller Router is distributed under the [GNU Affero General Public License,
version 3](LICENSE). The dependencies below are separate works; their own
licenses continue to apply. Go module versions are the direct and transitive
modules listed in this repository's `go.mod`.

## Go modules

| `golang.org/x/sys` | v0.47.0 | BSD-3-Clause | [LICENSE](https://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/LICENSE) |

The modernc.org modules form the SQLite implementation's transitive runtime
dependency set. The Go toolchain may also download additional modules in the
module graph; `go.mod` and `go.sum` are authoritative for a particular
checkout. The container image includes the applicable dependency license texts
under `/licenses`, including embedded subcomponent notices from the modernc.org
modules. Notices and source are also available from each upstream repository.

## Vendored frontend assets (shipped in the application image)

| Asset | Version | License | Upstream notice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/web/assets/d3.min.js` (D3.js, self-hosted for the Activity graph) | v7.9.0 | ISC | `internal/web/assets/D3-LICENSE`, [upstream LICENSE](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/LICENSE) |
| `internal/web/assets/media/providers/*.svg` (selected provider marks) | Simple Icons v16.29.0 | CC0-1.0 | [Simple Icons license](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/16.29.0/LICENSE.md) |

Provider mark mapping: Anthropic and Claude Code Subscription → `anthropic.svg`; DeepSeek → `deepseek.svg`; Google Gemini API → `google-gemini.svg`; GitHub Copilot → `github.svg`; Hugging Face → `huggingface.svg`; OpenRouter → `openrouter.svg`; OpenCode Zen/Go/Free → `opencode.svg`; Ollama Local/Cloud → `ollama.svg`; NVIDIA NIM → `nvidia.svg`. All other provider types use the in-UI monogram fallback. The SVG paths are derived from the pinned Simple Icons release; only CC0 assets with an available exact or parent-brand match were selected. Logos are decorative marks, not endorsements; provider names remain the identifying text.

## Test-only tooling and images

The browser test harness declares Playwright Test `1.55.0` in
`tests/browser/package.json` and `package-lock.json`. It is test-only and is
not shipped in the Tiller Router image; see the [Playwright license](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/LICENSE)
and the installed package notices when running the browser harness. The
compatibility and browser harnesses also use their declared test-container base
images, and the reverse-proxy smoke uses the official Nginx Alpine test image.
These test-only tools are not application runtime dependencies.

No provider SDK is included
in the application image. Review the upstream notices before redistributing a
modified build or a test environment.
